> Unofficial. Built on the ilink bot protocol (`https://ilinkai.weixin.qq.com`). Each QR scan binds one 1:1 bot — this is an ilink limitation; group chat is not supported.

## Features

- QR-code login, multi-account (each scanner = one independent bot, one `accounts/<bot_id>/` dir)
- MCP server exposing channel tools: `reply`, `edit_message`, `broadcast`, `send_file`, `set_user_name`
- Text, image, file and video delivery (CDN upload/download + AES-128-ECB encryption)
- Inbox directory for incoming media (paths surfaced in message metadata)
- Allowlist-based access control (persisted to `~/.claude/channels/wechat/access.json`)
- Live log monitor at `http://localhost:3456` (`wechat-cc logs`)
- Built-in WeChat slash commands: `/help`, `/status`, `/ping`, `/users`, `@all`, `@<name>`
- Auto-prompts Claude to ask for a name when a new sender appears; stored via `set_user_name`

## Install

Requirements:

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (tested with 1.1+)
- [Claude Code CLI](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)

Clone the repo and install deps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggshr9/wechat-cc.git
cd wechat-cc
bun install
```

Link the plugin into Claude Code. The plugin lives at `~/.claude/plugins/local/wechat/`; either clone directly there or symlink:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/plugins/local
ln -s "$(pwd)" ~/.claude/plugins/local/wechat
```

Optional: add the CLI to your `$PATH`:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/cli.ts" ~/.local/bin/wechat-cc
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/wechat-cc
```

## First-run setup

Each person who wants Claude to see their WeChat runs this **once**:

```bash
wechat-cc setup
```

A QR code prints in your terminal. Scan it with WeChat. On success, account state is written to `~/.claude/channels/wechat/accounts/<bot_id>/`. Repeat `wechat-cc setup` to bind additional accounts — each scan creates a separate directory and each is polled independently.

## Run

```bash
# Start Claude Code with the WeChat channel loaded, resuming the last session
wechat-cc run --dangerously

# Fresh session instead
wechat-cc run --fresh

# List already bound accounts
wechat-cc list

# Open the live log viewer in your browser
wechat-cc logs          # http://localhost:3456
wechat-cc logs 4567     # override port
```

Behind the scenes `run` invokes `claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:wechat` (or equivalent) so the MCP server is loaded at startup.

## Access control

The channel is **allowlist-only by default** — WeChat messages from users not on the allowlist are dropped silently.

Inside Claude Code:

```
/wechat:access                        # show policy + allowlist
/wechat:access allow <user_id>        # add a sender (user IDs look like xxx@im.wechat)
/wechat:access remove <user_id>       # remove
/wechat:access policy disabled        # kill the channel entirely
```

Access mutations **must only come from requests typed in the terminal**. The `access` skill refuses to modify the allowlist if the request arrived via an inbound WeChat message (prompt-injection surface).

## Channel commands (from WeChat)

| Command    | Effect                                                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/help`    | Show available commands                                         |
| `/status`  | Connection + account health                                     |
| `/ping`    | Connectivity test                                               |
| `/users`   | List online (bound) users                                       |
| `@all msg` | Broadcast to every connected user                               |
| `@名字 msg`| Forward to a specific user (name from `set_user_name`)          |

## State layout

```
~/.claude/channels/wechat/
├── access.json            # allowlist
├── context_tokens.json    # ilink context tokens (needed to initiate outbound messages)
├── user_names.json        # chat_id → display name
├── channel.log            # rolling log
├── server.pid             # single-instance lock
├── inbox/                 # downloaded media
└── accounts/
    └── <bot_id>/
        ├── account.json
        └── token          # bot bearer token, mode 0600
```

None of this is committed — it's all under `~/.claude/`, outside the repo.

## Architecture notes

- **Receive**: long-polling `POST /ilink/bot/getupdates` per account
- **Send**: `POST /ilink/bot/sendmessage` — outbound to a user requires a `context_token`; ilink won't deliver to anyone who hasn't sent at least one "hi" first
- **Typing indicator**: `/ilink/bot/sendtyping` fired on inbound, ticket cached ~60 s
- **Dedup**: `from_user_id:create_time_ms` key guards against at-least-once delivery
- **Media**: CDN upload/download with AES-128-ECB encryption
- **Retry**: outbound send retries 3× on timeout or 5xx, 1 s spacing

## Known limitations

- `context_token` bootstrap: you can't message a user who has never messaged the bot first
- Channel currently resets message history on server restart (no SQLite persistence)
- Session expiry / unauthorized sender flows silently drop messages today
- `cdn.ilinkai.weixin.qq.com` base URL is hardcoded — may need to be derived from account in the future

## Uninstall

```bash
# 1. Remove the Claude Code plugin symlink
rm ~/.claude/plugins/local/wechat

# 2. Remove the CLI symlink (if you added one)
rm ~/.local/bin/wechat-cc

# 3. Wipe all bound accounts, tokens, logs and inbox
rm -rf ~/.claude/channels/wechat

# 4. Drop the wechat entry from any project's .mcp.json
#    (edit the file and delete the "wechat" key under mcpServers)
```
